There are one csv file (ViewingActivity - sample) and all the code is explained in Netflix_data.ipyb file.
This project is based on Netflix personal data, so here we will figure out the following:
1. Calculate the total watch time ( In days) for one particular series.
2. Find out which day spends more time watching this show.
3. Find out when (24 hour format) you spend the most time watching this show.
